							My name is Eros Di Pede, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student studying at Carleton
							University in
							Ottawa, Ontario. I am working towards a Bachelor in Computer Science, with a specialization
							in
							Game Development. I'm an aspiring indie game developer and hope to release a
							game
							with a pal of mine very soon. Other than game
							development, I also have a strong interest in mobile and web development. In my free time, I
							work on various
							ongoing programming projects, watch TV shows, practice karate, and take pictures. I'm
							currently
							working on a few projects including, an Android
							app called Scrambled Eggs, and a computer game called Highlighters.

							<h3>Highlighters</h3>
							<h4> 2019 </h4>
							<div class="panel-body text-justify " style="text-justify: inter-character">
								<p>
									Highlighters is a simple tile swapping puzzle game that was developed in about a
									month.
									The game revolves around the matching of "Charms" with color coresponding "Bombs".
									A match occurs when a Bomb matches with two other game pieces.
									The objective of the game is to create matches as quickly as possible, while
									preventing the screen from filling up
									with game pieces.

							<h3>UFO Mayhem</h3>
							<h4> 2016 </h4>
							<div class="panel-body text-justify" style="text-justify: inter-character">
								<p>
									UFO Mayhem puts the player in the seat of an alien spaceship to cause havoc to a
									small, densely populated
									city. The main objective of the game is to abduct as many people as possible, as the
									human's military tries
									to put a stop to your mayhem. Abductions
									grant experience to the ship providing random upgrades varying from increased
									defense to extended ray length.
									As the player continues to abduct humans, the military will gradually increase their
									forces, beginning at
									policemen and finishing with
									helicopters.
									<br><br> UFO Mayhem is a 2D side-scroller developed by myself and a team of three
									other people. The game was
									developed in approximately 24 hours over the span of two weeks. The game was made
									for the Skills Canada
									competition held in Mississauga,
									Ontario. We managed to place 1st, bringing us our second gold as a game development
									team.

									Chaos lets players take control of a dual wielding skeleton inside of a treacherous
									dungeon. Players can pick
									up new spells and equipment to enhance their character to fight off various enemies
									ranging from clowns and
									dolls to disappearing ghosts and
									giant insects. The dungeon is randomly generated, so each player will be different
									from the previous!<br><br>
									Chaos is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler developed by myself and a team of three other

							<h4> 2018 </h4>
							<div class="panel-body text-justify" style="text-justify: inter-character">
								Scrambled Eggs is an Android application developed by myself and a friend. Essentially,
								users can use
								Scrambled Eggs to discover games they've never heard of using a few services provided by
								the app. To begin,
								the app recommends a new game to play every
								day. Although if users do not like the game of the day, or have played it previously,
								they can also generate
								random games or work through a questionnaire that will generate a game for them based on
								their answers.
